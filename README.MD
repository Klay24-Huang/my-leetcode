# my-leetcode

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems. The solutions are implemented in four programming languages: Go, C#, Node.js, and Python. Each language has its own directory, and within each directory, you'll find solutions to different algorithmic problems.

### C#
The `C#` directory contains solutions written in C#. These solutions demonstrate the use of .NET framework features, object-oriented programming principles, and efficient algorithms.

### Javascript
The `Javascript` directory includes solutions implemented in JavaScript, using Node.js for execution. These solutions highlight the use of standard algorithmic techniques in JavaScript.

### Python
The `Python` directory contains solutions written in Python. Python's simplicity and readability make it an ideal choice for solving a wide range of algorithmic challenges, from basic to advanced.

### Golang
The `Golang` directory features solutions written in Go. Known for its performance and concurrency support, Go is used here to solve problems efficiently and effectively.

## Key Features
- **Language Variety:** Solutions are provided in four different programming languages, showcasing versatility and adaptability in solving problems.
- **Algorithm Focus:** Each solution emphasizes algorithmic problem-solving, including various approaches such as binary search, backtracking, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and more.
- **Unit Testing:** Some of the solutions include unit tests for debugging and ensuring correctness.
